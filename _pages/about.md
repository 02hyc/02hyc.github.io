Hi there! I'm Huang Yanchen, now a junior at Software Institute, Nanjing University. I expect to go to Westlake University in 2025. Now I'm researching on Evolutionary Development in Westlake University with [Prof. Yaochu Jin](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/yaochu-jin.html). Besides, I'm interested in Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models, especially for the agents' self-evolution.
